# Answer

if planet == 1:
  print(f"Your Weight weight in mercury would be {weight}")
elif planet == 2:
  print(f"Your Weight weight in Venus would be {weight}")
elif planet == 3:
  print(f"Your Weight weight in Mars would be {weight}")
elif planet == 4: 
  print(f"Your Weight weight in Jupiter would be {weight}")
elif planet == 5:
  print(f"Your Weight weight in Saturn would be {weight}")
elif planet == 6:
  print(f"Your Weight weight in Uranus would be {weight}")
elif planet == 7:
  print(f"Your Weight weight in Neptune would be {weight}")
