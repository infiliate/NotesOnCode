# let me create a calculate that calculates the percentage of your marks from all the subjects you have, it will ask your subjects number, then will ask that many times you mark and then evaulate it.

# main varible
subjects_num = int(input("How many subjects you have? "))

marks = []

# the loop that repeats itself, so here we will use for loop

for x in range(subjects_num): # this will repeat by the times, user has inputted number
    mark = float(input(f"How many marks you scored in subject {x+1}: ")) # this will added a text string that is loop range + 1
    marks.append(mark) # So this will add list the number got from this loop to marks

total_marks = sum(marks) # this will added all the numbers from the marks list and eventually create total number of marks

calculation = (total_marks / (subjects_num * 100)) * 100
# the formula to get average is p/q*100, here there was, no q because user given 7, so to make out of 700, we had multiply

print(f"Total Marks: {total_marks}")
print(f"Your Percentage: {calculation:.2f}%") # .2f = decimal point fixed to 2.
