# I need to create a program that helps kids of what is the percentage in 100 out of 700 marks, and also assigns a A Grade, below 90 is A, below 80 is B, below 70 is C, >= 60 is D and below > 60 is F

english = int(input("how many marks you scored in English? "))
hindi = int(input("how many marks you scored in Hindi? "))
sst = int(input("how many marks you scored in SST? "))
punjabi = int(input("how many marks you scored in Punjabi? "))
math = int(input("how many marks you scored in Math? "))
sceince = int(input("how many marks you scored in Sceince? "))
IT = int(input("how many marks you scored in IT? "))

your_grade = english + hindi + sst + punjabi + sceince + IT + math

print(f"The sum of all your subject out of 700 is {your_grade}")

total_marks = 700
percentage = 100
grade = percentage * (your_grade / total_marks)

messege = "you have gotten: "
messege2 = "we are sorry, "

print(f"your percentage is {grade}")

if grade > 90:
  print(f"{messege} A ")
elif grade > 80:
  print(f"{messege}B")
elif grade > 70:
  print(f"{messege}C")
elif grade > 60:
  print(F"{messege}D")
else: 
  print (F"{messege2} {messege}F")

print("Thank you for using the School Percentage Converter!")
